Final mark: **30/30 with praise**

The proposed solution is a hybrid recommendation system leveraging a linear combination of Expanded-Item-Item Collaborative Filtering and Compact Item-Item Collaborative Filtering based on query result cardinality.

The solution is described in a [report](https://github.com/vicentinileonardo/query-recommendation-system/blob/main/report.pdf).

A [README](https://github.com/vicentinileonardo/query-recommendation-system/blob/main/src/README.txt) in the src folder describes how to run the code.
