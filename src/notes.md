## Issue #01
+ problem when the query row has as only 0s as rating availables
+ This issue has been solved 

## Issue #02
+ if the matrix is very small, the case where there is only 1 rating led to the excpetion code path
+ probably not relevant, only in testing phase


for q64, good ratings calculated (if an example to check is needed)
